# Movie Elo Project

- *movie-elo* uses the Elo rating system to rank movies by asking the user to choose which movie they prefer.
- Currently, movies are drawn from a csv file of manually entered movies (`movies.csv`).
- Eventually, it will use the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to serve the user movies directly from their database.
